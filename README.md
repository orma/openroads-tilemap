# openroads-tilemap

Serves tiles generated by `orma/openroads-tiler`.


## Running locally
### requirements
- docker
- s3 bucket containing tiles generated by the openroads-tiler (publicly accessible).


### environment variables
You'll need to specify the `BUCKET_URL` environment variable which points to the S3 tiles. This will be substituted at runtime in `openroads.tilejson` which is the data source that Mapnik uses in each of the styles.

### generated styles
Styles are in the `styles` folder and generated using the `carto` tool (`npm install -g carto`).
If you want to modify a style, commit the generated xml file as well.

e.g:
```
carto styles/base-style/or-project.mml > styles/base-style/or-style.xml
```

### build & run

```
docker build -t openroads-tilemap .
docker run -d -p 80:3000 -e BUCKET_URL=http://XXXXX.amazonaws.com openroads-tilemap
```

## docker
